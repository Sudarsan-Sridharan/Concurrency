/**
 * Threads often have to coordinate their actions. The most common coordination 
 * idiom is the guarded block. Such a block begins by polling a condition that 
 * must be true before the block can proceed. Such a method could, in theory, 
 * simply loop until the condition is satisfied, but that loop is wasteful, 
 * since it executes continuously while waiting.A more efficient guard invokes 
 * Object.wait to suspend the current thread. The invocation of wait does not 
 * return until another thread has issued a notification that some special event 
 * may have occurred â€” though not necessarily the event this thread is waiting 
 * for
 * Note: Always invoke wait inside a loop that tests for the condition being 
 * waited for. Don't assume that the interrupt was for the particular condition 
 * you were waiting for, or that the condition is still true.Let's use guarded 
 * blocks to create a Producer-Consumer application. This kind of application 
 * shares data between two threads: the producer, that creates the data, and the 
 * consumer, that does something with it. The two threads communicate using a 
 * shared object. Coordination is essential: the consumer thread must not attempt 
 * to retrieve the data before the producer thread has delivered it, and the 
 * producer thread must not attempt to deliver new data if the consumer hasn't 
 * retrieved the old data.
